<p>During my front-end developer work experience at RDT Limited I created a Harry Potter Yearbook web application on the
   Blazor platform using C# and some HTML. Up until this point, I had primarily used python as my main programming language 
   so it was quite a jump due to the additional symbols involved.</p>

<p>I’m what you call an anime enthusiast as I have loved watching it from a young age. This fostered an interest in Japanese
   Culture and Language. I then went on to use several  language learning apps like Duolingo, Busuu and Bunpo to continuously
   develop my Japanese. Every Sunday I am Volunteering at the New Wine Church Maidstone. I typically assist with the lifting,
   setting up & packing away of equipment in the church. I also perform Multi media duties whilst the service is underway, 
   displaying bible verses, songs and presentations</p>
